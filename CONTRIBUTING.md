# Contributing

Contributions of all types are welcome. Here are some guidelines intented to make everybody's life a little easier. I am always open to new ideas, so if you have a suggestion on how to improve this process please submit an issue.

## Submit an Issue

Before doing anything, please submit an issue on GitHub. (https://github.com/sbanwart/todo.txt-extras/issues) This will help to coordinate efforts and ensure multiple people aren't working on the same thing.

Submitting issues is also good if you want to report a defect or work on non-code items like documentation.

## Pull Requests

* Please include a reasonably detailed description of your changes.
* Please keep individual pull requests small and easy to understand. If you are submitting many changes in different parts of the script, please break them up into small, logical commits and create a pull request for each one.
